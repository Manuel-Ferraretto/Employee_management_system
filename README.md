## Spring Boot Project
Welcome to my Spring Boot project! This project is a result of my hands-on experience with the Spring Boot framework. It serves as a practical application of my knowledge and skills in developing Java applications using Spring Boot. The aim is to try to put coding best practices into practice as regard the backend development. 

## Project Overview


 - Technology Stack: The project utilizes the Spring Boot framework along with MySQL as the database management system, along with other complementary technologies (Thymeleaf, JavaScript, css - bootstrap), libraries (ajax) and ORM (Hibernate)
- Architecture: The project follows a well-structured architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability of the codebase.
- Features: I have implemented various features and functionalities in the project, demonstrating my understanding of key concepts such as dependency management, auto-configuration, and API development. 
Database Integration: The project includes integration with a relational database using JPA (Java Persistence API) for data access and persistence.
